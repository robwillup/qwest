`Quest` is an application for creating *tasks* straight from the command line. If you are in a terminal all you have to do is:

```PowerShell
quest new todo "Create new unit tests" --tag "MyWebApp" --remind "date-time"
```

The new *to-do* will be saved and a reminder will appear at the chosen time.
